# NetORC
The Net Orchestrator lays the foundation for central network orchestration. It acts as an intermediary between your business support systems and the network automation tooling of your choice. By being tool agnostic, the project aims to enhance the adoption of automation into other business functions through its simple-to-use API.

## Project Goals
- Develop an open-source, vendor-agnostic network orchestrator API.
- Prioritize reliability and usability over speed.
- Provide a set of helpful add-ons to support the adoption of central orchestration.
- Enable scheduling and feedback of job progress.

## Architectural Principles
- The orchestrator should lay the foundations for bespoke customization and improvement, rather than trying to be exhaustive.
- The orchestrator should not prohibit the use of a data formatter or network driver.
